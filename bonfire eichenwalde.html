        You find yourself in a familiar sight: finally, some tiled floor and
        brick wall!
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it seems battle is taking place just outside.</p>
      <p>
        You peer out of the nearby window to see a rather peculiar sight: a
        mixture of automatons, people, and everything in between are fighting on
        a bridge near the castle entrance. They're surrounded by rusted
        automatons, most likely from a battle long ago.
      </p>
      <p>The bonfires decides to fill you in.</p>
      <p>
        One side is attempting to recover the armor of a great leader, and are
        escorting a large battering ram alongside a cart to carry their spoils,
        while the other is attempting to keep it sacred in its resting place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiple people fall in the battle, but they come running back into the
        fray no less than 15 seconds later.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don't really get it, but what can you do? After a quick glance at
        the bonfire, it seems to have been built whenever the original battle at
        this castle took place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, after a long struggle, the attackers manage to breach the
        castle door.
      </p>
      <p>
        As interesting as it would be to see the battle to its end, moving will
        expose you to the fighters.

        The ground beneath you shifts once more, and you can hear the sounds
        of...
