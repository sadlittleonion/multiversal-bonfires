        The distant distinct sounds of explosions make the ground underneath you
        tremble.
      </p>
      <p>
        You sit amongst a small set of trees overlooking a big river with
        multiple trenches and bunkers built into either side, all facing a
        single direction. Soldiers dressed in light blue rags are hard at work,
        setting up sandbag defenses and blocking the bridge off with strange
        metal structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bonfire tells you that although the fighting is currently farther
        away from the river, the world is engulfed in war and soon the fighting
        will descend upon the river.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the bonfire itself, it appears that a cavalry sword was stuck
        through. Probably some captain decided to rest up from maintaining
        defenses here.
      </p>
      <p>
        An explosion lands directly in the riverbed. All the soldiers setting up
        defenses instantly scramble to their positions, rifles at the ready.
        Across the way from them, a mass of soldiers in the same rags are
        retreating from moving machines and soldiers dressed in dark gray.
      </p>
      <p>You get the feeling you should probably leave.</p>
      <p>The ground shifts around you once more.</p>
