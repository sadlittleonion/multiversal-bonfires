      <p>It appears you've landed in a rather gruesome scene.</p>
      <p>
        The bonfire has a staff in it as opposed to the standard sword, but also
        the staff appears to have pierced some poor soul before the fire was
        lit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even weirder is your surroundings. Metal plates, all in various
        patterns, are strung up on the rock wall behind you
      </p>
      <p>
        The bonfire explains that the world has been turned into a desert, and
        people use machines to travel and fight for their survival.
      </p>
      <p>
        These could be extra adornings for their vehicles, or maybe trophies of
        vehicles destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the distance, you can see dust trails kicking up as two vehicles
        exchange volleys of strikes and fire blasts at each other.
      </p>
      <p>They seem to be veering off towards your direction.</p>
      <p>You need to get out of here.</p>
      <p>
        The sand beneath you falls away and the sounds of machines fighting is
        now replaced with...
